  <section>
    <h2>How to request account deletion</h2>
    <p>We support two simple ways to request deletion. Choose whichever works for you:</p>

    <h3>1) Email request (recommended)</h3>
    <p>Send an email from the address associated with your AI Threads account to:</p>
    <p><strong><a href="mailto:avengers14.blogger+AIThreads@gmail.com<?subject=AI%20Threads%20Account%20Deletion%20Request">avengers14.blogger+AIThreads@gmail.com</a></strong></p>
    <p class="muted">Include in the email: your account email, your username (if any), and a short statement asking us to delete your account and associated data.</p>


  <section>
    <h2>What we will delete</h2>
    <p>When you request account deletion, we will remove:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your authentication record (email/login)</li>
      <li>Your user profile (display name, avatar)</li>
      <li>All content you uploaded or created (posts, images, videos, comments)</li>
      <li>Associated metadata (user id mapping, preferences, saved items)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some aggregated or anonymized analytics data and logs may be retained for debugging and legal purposes in a non-identifying form.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What we may keep and retention periods</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Backups: We may keep encrypted backups for up to <strong>30 days</strong> after deletion requests to allow recovery in case of accidental deletion. Backups are removed as part of our regular retention schedule.</li>
      <li>Legal records: If required by law (e.g., for investigation), limited records may be retained for the minimum period required by law.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Verification & Processing time</h2>
    <p>To protect your account, we will verify deletion requests by confirming the email address associated with the account or by requiring a valid authentication token. After verification we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Begin deletion processing within <strong>48 hours</strong>.</li>
      <li>Complete deletion of live data within <strong>30 days</strong> (excluding backups/legal retention noted above).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Partial data deletion / export</h2>
    <p>If you want certain data removed (e.g., specific posts or uploaded images) without deleting your account, contact us at the same email above and specify which items to remove. We can also provide a copy of your data on request (data export) — include "EXPORT" in your request.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Questions or disputes</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, did not request deletion, or need help, email us at <a href="mailto:[YOUR EMAIL]">[YOUR EMAIL]</a>. We aim to respond within 7 business days.</p>
